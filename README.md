# A hypertextual approach to "A Pattern Language" (Christopher Alexander)

I think _A Pattern Language_ is an overwhelming book for most people that try to read it. The fact that we're approaching the language in a linear way, due to the limitations of the book format does not help. Yes, some people may spend the time to slowly uncover the language by reading in all the directions suggested by the links on each pattern, but most will probably take an isolated read, more prone to set themselves in an easier task, finding inconsistencies in a specific passage, or specific idea, away from building upon (or criciticising) the work as a whole.

So in this experiment I tried to encourage a networked reading of the work, one where you can see connected patterns from the very beginning. I hope that this helps with contextualising the parts of the whole language. But that's yet to be seen.

## Creating a mini-language for a project

Another difficult flow that I'd like to encourage is the selection of a set of patterns into a mini-language that's picked to be useful in a specific project. Therefore this computer program will help you to pick your set of patterns and go through a subset of the pattern language, your mini-language for that project.

This introduces a powerful idea: A pattern language can also act as a method of coordination between people for co-creation, without being too detailed so as to kill individual contribution and initiative but coherent so that each people's contribution helps a common whole.

By creating a mini-language with peers you'll be able if you're in the same page as them, and can then proceed in a more loose manner.

## Your own pattern language

The logic conclusion of this line of thought is that you're not to only pick patterns from this _A Pattern Language_ work. You want to create _your_ own pattern language, whether you are a person or a group of people.

That's out of the scope of this experiment, but I think that's the ultimate goal, and ideally, you'd need hypertextual tooling that also allows you to write and edit.

## Greatly inspired by

Thanks to Max Krieger and Mikael Brockman for works that I've built upon, and I'm sure they've also built upon the work of others, just for the idea of presenting A Pattern Language in a different form than the original book.
